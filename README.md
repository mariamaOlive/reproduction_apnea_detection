# A Reproducibility study of Apnea Detection

Group 2:
- Ernest Onifade
- Harry Setiawan Hamjaya
- Mariama Oliveira

This repository is a reproducibility study of the paper ["Toward sleep apnea detection with lightweight multi-scaled fusion network."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705122003689) by Chen et al. The main goal of the paper is to develop a lightweight model able detect apnea based on single lead ECG recordings.
